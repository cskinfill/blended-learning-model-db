Data Quality
------------

The current set of data is a good rough stab, but it is by no means
complete. There are a number of quality questions that we'll need
to answer to address to make this top-notch.

The biggest question is missing schools. For instance, in the private schools
database, there is no listing for Anastasis Academy. In the CMO
listing, there is no Rocketship Education. This is a large problem.

We also need to validate the accuracy of data and make sure it's up
to date. There may be better places to download or buy more recent
data, but we'll have to explore.
