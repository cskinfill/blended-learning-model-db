<h1>Innosight Model Database Viewer</h1>

<p>
The Innosight Institute maintains <a href="http://www.innosightinstitute.org/media-room/publications/blended-learning/blended-learning-profiles-all-profiles/">a list of fascinating case studies of schools that have experimented
with some form of blended learning. In 2012, they wrote <a href="http://www.innosightinstitute.org/media-room/publications/education-publications/the-rise-of-k-12-blended-learning/">a white paper</a> with findings from about 40 of them.
Since then, they have accepted user submissions and grown the list of models. However, on the website it's
not that easy to sort and filter the models, especially as it grows.
</p>
<p>
This website offers a simple visual layer on top of the data offered by Innosight. You can use this tool
to search, filter, and sort by a few major criteria. Click through any of the models to read the much more
in-depth coverage on the Innosight website.
